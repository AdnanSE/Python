Describe how the maxsplit parameter for the split method works.

The maxsplit parameter puts an upper threshold on how many times a string can be split by a separator / delimiter. Once the limit is reached, the remaining substring is used as the last element in the returned list.

What is list comprehension?

List comprehension is a shorthand syntax for generating a new list from an existing iterable. It allows us to apply the same operation to each element from a starting list, each character in a string, etc.

What is the difference between the split and the join methods?

Both methods are invoked on a string object. The split method splits or cuts a string based on the occurrences of a separator or delimiter. It returns a list of all the sliced elements. The join method does the opposite; it converts a list of strings into a single concatenated string. The string that the join method is invoked on serves as the separator between every two subsequent strings.

What error is raised if the argument passed to the index method doesn’t exist in the list?

A ValueError is raised.

What’s been your favorite method or list feature so far?

I like them all! If I had to choose, list comprehensions are always fun to write.
